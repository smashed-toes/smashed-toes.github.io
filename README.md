# My Personal Acting Website

As a Software Engineer and an Actor, building my own personal website was the first obvious way to combine two of my passions. Ever since I began formally studying Computer Science in my Sophomore year at Brown I have been excited by the ways in which technology and performance art intersect. Using this website as a tool to promote my art and my work is one of the potentially infinite ways that these two fields begin to intersect.

To jumpstart my website creation process I decided to use Jekyll which lends itself to simple blog-aware websites.

Although manipulated, I borrowed heavily from the Beautful Jekyll template created by Dean Attalli (https://deanattali.com).
