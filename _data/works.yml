  description: This monologue is from the play "The Unavoidable Disappearance of Tom Durnin" written by Steven Levinson. The performance took place during my "Voice - The Actors Instrument" class at Brown University, taught by the very talented Rebecca Gibel. You'll hear how she offers excellent guidance as I move into, through, and out of the monologue. This reading of it became very important and emotionally charged for me and opened me up in a new and exciting way.

  description: This monologue, from the solo show "Wake Up and Smell The Coffee", was my final for a iPhone moviemaking class at Brown University taught by emmy-winning filmmaker and producer Ted Bogosian. This long solo performance was a great exercise in making very intentional choices that were the driving force behind the arc of the piece.
