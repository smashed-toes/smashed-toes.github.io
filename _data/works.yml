  description: This monologue is from the play "The Unavoidable Disappearance of Tom Durnin" written by Steven Levinson. The performance took place during my "Voice - The Actors Instrument" class at Brown University, taught by Rebecca Gibel. You'll hear how she offers excellent guidance as I move into, through, and out of the monologue. This reading of it became very important and emotionally charged for me and opened me up in a new and exciting way. I hope you enjoy it!
