Sam Masto is an actor and singer born and raised in San Francisco. He was first exposed to the horrors of student theater when he was 13 and never looked back. He enrolled in Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center where he spent his summers playing roles like Charlemagne in Pippin and originated the role of Jake in Evil Dead The Musical (High School Version).

In September of 2017 he enrolled in Brown University and studied Computer Science between shows and rehearsals. He began screen acting his Sophomore year when he acted in his first production with the student film group, Brown Motion Pictures (BMP). Between BMP, independent film projects, and student theater, he's played roles varying from villainous mattress shop owners to romantic film directors. He furthered his passion for acting in the Theater Arts and Performance Studies (TAPS) department through extensive classes and productions, and in 2021 was awarded the MH Hicks Award for outstanding and dedicated work in the department.

After graduating in May of 2021, he realized that he never should have left California and moved to LA with the goal of wearing a t-shirt in January. Since arriving, he's starred in a number of graduate student films from USC, LMU, and NYFA. In his free time, you can find him surfing waves, strumming a guitar, and drinking pi√±a coladas in the rain.
